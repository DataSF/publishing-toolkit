# Inventory Update

While we ask departments to update the inventory on an annual basis, we also accept rolling submissions.

These submissions come most often through the [publishing intake form](/1_submission/README.md).

On this form, the publisher can either:
* select *Dataset not in inventory* as an option
* change any prefilled information from the inventoried record

DataSF staff then make sure to update the inventory as needed.

In the case of a new record, staff assign a unique inventory ID which is used to tie all collateral together throughout the publishing.

Inventory updates are made in our master dataset and systems inventory (a customized google sheet) and the data are synced daily to [the open data portal as two separate datasets](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?q=systems+inventory&tags=ref%3Ainventory).
