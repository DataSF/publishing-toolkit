# Zapier

## What is it

Zapier is an automation platform that links cloud APIs together. You can connect triggers in one application to actions in another. These can be chained together and data mutated as needed.

While many of these integrations can be scripted, Zapier saves you the time of having to figure out 100s of APIs.

## How does it support our process?

Zapier is used to connect our various systems. We use it to automatically:

1. Automatically create help desk cases and [Trello](/technology/trello.md) cards at intake
2. Log activity from the Trello Board in a [Google Sheet](/technology/sheets.md)
2. Log activity from [Desk.com](/technology/desk.md) in a [Google Sheet](/technology/sheets.md)

Pictured below is an example action set up in Zapier that writes a new Trello card. It's triggered on submission of the Screendoor form.
