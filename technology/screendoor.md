[Learn more about Screendoor](https://www.dobt.co/screendoor/).

## How does it support our process?

Screendoor provides the [embedded form](https://datasf.org/publishing) used during [our publishing intake](/1_submission/README.md) pictured below. Forms can be customized through the platform as well as with code. We've customized our form to:

1. Support our downstream business process needs \(like assessing publishing options\)
2. Pre-fill data from other sources to save publishers time on data entry \(where inventory records exist\)
3. Match our site styles
