A help desk platform from Salesforce. 

[Learn more about Desk.com](https://www.desk.com/).

## How does it support our process?

Desk allows us to communicate with publishers and capture information in a single place.

Since our entire team can access the help desk, we can all see communication about a job without being CC'd on everything.

Desk cases are created automatically from the Screendoor form using Zapier.

### Which processes does it support?

Primarily processes that involve touchpoints with the department: 

* [Submission and Intake](1_submission/README.md)
* [Release Toolkit Review](3_release_toolkit_review/README.md)
* [Manual Publishing](4_manual_publishing/README.md)
* [ETL Specification](5_etl_specification/README.md)
* [Review and Approval](7_review_and_approval/README.md)
