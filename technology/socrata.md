## What is it

An open data platform that provides:

1. A catalog search of datasets and related assets
2. Cloud storage for data
3. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) [for every hosted dataset](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/endpoints.html)
4. Visualization tools and external tool integrations (through APIs)

## How does it support our process?

Socrata Publica powers https://data.sfgov.org where data users inside and outside the City can discover public datasets.

Through Socrata's publishing tools including [DataSync](http://socrata.github.io/datasync/) and a [Publisher API](https://dev.socrata.com/publishers/getting-started.html), we can script data to automatically load as part of the final step in ETL.

Socrata Publica enables searching and using hundreds of public datasets.
