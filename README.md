# Publishing Toolkit

The publishing toolkit describes how DataSF supports open data publishing. The processes herein are the outcome of continuous improvements that reflect the City's context. That context includes:

1. **A highly federated IT environment.** Federated IT means a range of systems sitting in different physical and virtual locations. Processes have been designed to establish patterns and create consistency where possible. They are flexible enough to adapt to a variety of configurations.
2. **An orientation toward scale and institutional support.** 

Values embodied in the publishing processes?

* User orientation
* Process optimization
* Continuous feedback and improvement
